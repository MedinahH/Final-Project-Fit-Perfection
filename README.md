Application Name: # Final-Project-Fit-Perfection

Technology used for Front End:
The front-end framework we will use is Angular.
A development environment and project structure will be set up.
A basic layout and components for the user interface will be created.
Responsive design using CSS, and possibly SCSS.
Front-end code will be test and debugged to the best of ability in the 6 week time-frame, with the goal of continuing these processes beyond the project timeline (and post-graduation).

Back End:, 

Database:
mySQL, NoSQL

Software Proposal:
FITPERFECTION software is a program that utilizes body scan technology and fabric properties to improve the fit of garments. The program will provide accurate body measurements and create patterns that can be used to produce garments that fit more comfortably and effectively.
The primary business objective of this project is to enhance customer satisfaction by reducing the number of returns due to poorly fitting garments. The software program will enable garment manufacturers to provide a more personalized and accurate fit for their customers, resulting in increased customer loyalty and retention.
Another important objective of this project is to increase operational efficiency and reduce costs associated with returns and exchanges. By using body scan technology and fabric properties, the software program will assist technical designers in providing them more body measurements in reduced time as well as an account for the properties of the fabric the garment will be sampled in. This will reduce the time it takes to measure models multiple times and automatically account for the stretch and unique properties of each garment used in production.
Ultimately, the successful completion of this project will result in a competitive advantage for the garment manufacturer, as they will be able to provide a superior customer experience while optimizing their production processes.

This project is important because proper fit of a garment is essential to reducing returns, creating customer loyalty with flattering and consistent fit, and reducing overall waste from discarding clothes that donâ€™t fit properly. 
This technology can also be used from the customer side in helping to pick ready made garments or made to measure garments that fit their personal measurements more accurately. Currently, having to try on clothes is essential because our bodies change often, Clothing companies use different measurement standards, different brands use different fabrics and manufacturing processes, and different fabrics behave on the body differently. This software program will be designed to help take the guesswork out of fit by having a database comprised of sizes by brand.
